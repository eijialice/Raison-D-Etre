## Idea Plot <br />
  The World has gave its people a chance to fight against the common evil, <br />
  After the war, and many years had passed, only of the church continues to sing their praises, <br />
  In an extreme manner, by slaughtering those that go against their will or faith. <br />
  Every once in a while, a hero is born, but never cherished. <br />
  Someone to be feared, their sin of being born as such. <br />
