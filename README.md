## Idea Plot <br />
      The World has gave its people a chance to fight against the common evil,
      After the war, and many years had passed, only of the church continues to sing their praises, 
      In an extreme manner, by slaughtering those that go against their will or faith. 
      Every once in a while, a hero is born, but never cherished. 
      Someone to be feared, their sin of being born as such.
