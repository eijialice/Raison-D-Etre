Karma and Sanity Meters: (Add a threshold so lets say if your sanity gets below 0/-10 the more buffs you get)

Sanity meter, the sanity of the protagonist.
Generally speaking, the higher your sanity is, the more "in control" you are, and the lower your sanity is, the less in control your character is.
For combat, lower sanity is better if you are going a solo run as, the lower your sanity gets, the more damage buffs 
your character gets, in exchange for being "uncontrollable" (You might target allies or if you get low enough, you might start attacking random enemies)
(And if it gets even lower than that, you might not have control over what items you use and guarding / running away will be disabled, if you go that low)
If you have a higher sanity, you don't get any buffs in exchange for higher "precision" and more control of who to target. 

Certain gear and skills may also be unlocked / be useable if at a low sanity. And  gears / skills may also be enhanced / debuffed depending on the item.
(Maybe a assasination mechanic will be added soon? if it is added it might be disbaled in favor for a straight ambush / fistfight.)

For story purposes:

If your sanity is low, you will get locked out decisions that require a stable or rational mind (for example negotitations, not that negotiations will be a thing, probably.) in favor of violence.
This part might have an RNG part, like sometimes you cant even buy stuff and will just straight up try to kill whoever it is you are talking to if your sanity gets down by a huge amount. 
ALong with that, some stuff might be replaced by some creepy or unintelligible stuff if you do become insane.
And, if you have a high sanity, choices, paths and dialgoue will appear normal. Generally speaking, a higher sanity will allow more routes, items and other shit to be "visible" to you.


Karma meter, the metaphysical representation of the protagonists actions.

For *literal* combat purposes, this meter largely does not matter.

For story purposes, this is the main driving force behind the game's mechanics like, story, routes and fights will be locked behind a Karma threshold.
Having a high karma means your "alignment" will be "good" while having low karma will be "bad"
Opportunities like other people joining your party will be low as you might appear to be a untrustworthy person at a low karma. 
In this story, you explore many places that treat karma differently, for example: A sector of the city, that is obsessed with remaining "pure"
so, if you have a low karma, the people residing there and guards might treat you harshly if your karma is "just low" but if you have an excessively low karma, 
they might straight up just kill you if you try and interact with them, and go even lower than that they might just chase your ass at the gate 
(Not really a concrete example but depending on your karma level, you might get more rewards if you enter a place that actively worships debauchery for exampple.)
(This will also tie in to the Black Market game mechanic, some items, services and jobs will be locked behind certain karma, so missions that include alot of killing will be locked behing low karma. You also get discounts and stuff possibly. (Maybe scrapped?)

Lastly, the difficulty and number of fights (as mentioned above will be much harder / easier depeding on what threshold you've hit.)

Permanent Karma:
This is a route lock mechanic, after this, you can't gain or lose any karma above / below a certain threshold. 

It's so you don't kill everybody to purposely get your sanity / karma low, fight the hardest bosses, get the most op gear, replenish your saniuty / karma via the various methods then go to the "easier" part of the game.
If you're in the good route, killing and other "bad" actions will be no longer available once your "Permanent Karma" has been set.
